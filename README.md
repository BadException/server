# NFCGate Server
This is the NFCGate server application. It is using python 2.7 and the Google [Protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf/) library, version 2.6.1. Please make sure that this version of Protobuf is installed (and NOT the new 3.X version, which is incompatible with our Server, as it makes incompatible changes).

To run, simply start the server using `python server.py`. You can then connect to the server using the IP address of your device and the default port of 5566.
